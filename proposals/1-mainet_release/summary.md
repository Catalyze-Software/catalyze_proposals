# Motion Proposal: Catalyze V1.0 Mainnet Release

## Overview

Following an extensive 90-day beta testing period, the Catalyze DAO Association is excited to propose the release of Catalyze V1.0's Mainnet version. This new version, developed in response to valuable user feedback, is designed to enhance functionality and improve user experience. It's crucial to note that existing data from the beta version will not be transferred to the Mainnet version; however, users will retain access to their assets within their in-platform wallets on the beta version. To facilitate this transition, following this motion pass, we will halt the creation of new groups and user accounts on the current beta platform, setting the stage for a clean start on the Mainnet version. This approach ensures that all users will benefit from the new features without being hindered by legacy data and inactive groups.

## Strategic Mainnet Enhancements for Catalyze's Long-Term Success

### Community Leader Token Incentives

We will be introducing a comprehensive token reward system to honor and compensate our active community leaders for achieving key milestones like group growth and on-platform event attendance. This initiative aims to motivate the key individuals driving engagement and growth within Catalyze, ensuring recognition for their pivotal roles in nurturing our community.

### Easy-type URLs

Implementing clean, short URLs will simplify the process of inviting new members, making link-sharing more accessible.

### Comprehensive Platform Reset

In our pursuit of the highest quality experience, we are implementing a full platform reset. This will clear all existing groups and content, primarily from our beta testing phase, removing clutter and spam, and ensuring that only active, vibrant groups populate the Catalyze Mainnet. This foundational reset is key to fostering high-quality engagement and interaction.

### Strategic Categorization for Discovery

The updated system introduces precisely defined categories for events and groups, tailored to align with Catalyze's strategic objectives, ensuring discoverability, improved data organization, and management.

### Enhanced Backend Performance & Speed

Strategic backend optimizations to improve the platform's speed and responsiveness. These improvements are essential for ensuring a smoother and more efficient user experience.

### Refined Interface

The platform will feature an updated UI/UX, including new fonts and a refreshed color scheme. These changes are designed to enhance the visual appeal and intuitiveness, subtly improving navigation and user interaction for a more seamless experience.

## Step-by-Step Transition Plan

### Platform Deactivation

Upon approval of this proposal, we will notify Catalyze users on-platform and proceed to take the current Catalyze beta platform offline within 3 weeks. This step is to prevent the creation of new groups and personal accounts, ensuring a clean transition to the new platform.

### Landing Page and Countdown

A dedicated landing page will be set up to provide users with detailed information about the transition and how they can participate in the Mainnet launch. This page will feature a countdown to the official launch of the new version, keeping our community informed and engaged, with incentives and rewards.

### Legacy URL Management

The existing URL, chat.catalyze.one, will remain active for one year after the Mainnet launch with the new URL. This continuity is crucial for facilitating the smooth migration of assets, such as tokens and NFTs, from in-platform wallets to the new system.

### New URL Transition

The new platform will be hosted at the new URL: app.catalyze.one. This change marks the official transition to the Mainnet version, where users will experience enhanced features and a refreshed interface.

This structured approach ensures a clear and organized transition, minimizing disruption for our users and setting the stage for the future success of the Catalyze platform.

## Conclusion

This proposal represents a strategic transformation of the Catalyze platform, shaped by our community's feedback and a vision for excellence. By endorsing this plan, the Catalyze community will facilitate a smooth transition to the Mainnet version that enhances user experience, optimizes engagement, and supports vibrant community interactions. We invite the DAO to approve this proposal, enabling us to embark on this exciting new chapter together and ensuring Catalyze's continued success and innovation.
